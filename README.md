## Simulating PDEs on a Quantum Computer


This repository contains research on using IBM's Quantum Computer to simulate PDEs. We solve the Heat Equation (left) accurately on a quantum computer. The Advection Equation (right) cannot be solved accurately due to discretization errors.

We solve both of these equations using the same quantum circuits. In the paper, we talk about extending these simulations to the Inviscid Burger's Equation and other PDEs in general.
