## Quantum Computing Research


In my undergrad at Cornell, I researched methods of using Quantum Computers to solve Partial Differential Equations, including the Heat, Advection, and Burger's Equations. I created simulations that can run on IBM's Quantum Computer. Here are some of my results. The Heat Equation (left) can accurately be solved on a quantum computer, while the Advection Equation (right) cannot due to discretization errors.
