## Simulating PDEs on a Quantum Computer


This repository contains simulations of the Heat and Advection Equations that can run on IBM's Quantum Computer. Here are some of my results - the Heat Equation (left) can accurately be solved on a quantum computer, while the Advection Equation (right) cannot due to discretization errors.
