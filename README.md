## Simulating PDEs on a Quantum Computer


This repository contains research on using IBM's Quantum Computer to simulate PDEs. The Heat Equation (left) can accurately be solved on a quantum computer, while the Advection Equation (right) cannot due to discretization errors.

Both of these equations are solved using the same quantum circuits. In my paper, we talk about extending these simulations to the Inviscid Burger's Equation and other PDEs in general.
